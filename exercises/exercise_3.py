# Create a class that provides some statistics drawn from
# a dataset. 

# The dataset is an Excel file that can be read with the
# function read_excel of the Pandas library. Columns headers
# can conveniently be used as the names of the variables
# that are instances of the class. 

# Thus create an instance of the class for each column 
# of the dataset
